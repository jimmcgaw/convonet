# Machine Learning with Theano

This repo is for playing around with code snippets that leverage the Python theano library for machine learning.

## To Get Started

Install dependencies via pip:

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

You can test your installation with the sample script ```hello.py```

``` $ python hello.py```

which should output the vector: [0, 2, 1026]
