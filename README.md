# Machine Learning with Python

This repo is for playing around with code snippets that leverage the Python theano library for machine learning.

## To Get Started

This is a repository that I keep on my local machine for doing just about any kind of data science
or machine learning with the popular Python frameworks. It's also where I go to play with numpy and scipy.

Take a look at the requirements.txt file. The experienced among you should recognize that installing all of these
on your system is going to take a LONG TIME. Consider yourself warned.

Install dependencies via pip:

``` $ pip install -r requirements.txt ```

You can test your installation with the sample script ```hello.py```

``` $ python hello.py```

which should output the vector: [0, 2, 1026]
